This is a placeholder file for the app icon. 

To create a beautiful app icon for the Random Quote Generator:

1. Create a square image (recommended 1024x1024 pixels) with a design representing quotes/inspiration
2. Good design ideas:
   - A stylized speech bubble or quotation marks
   - An open book with a quote appearing from it
   - A lightbulb with quotation marks inside (representing ideas)
   - A pen writing a quote
   - Abstract geometric shapes forming a quote symbol

3. Save the image as app_icon.png in this directory (assets/icons/)

4. Run the following command to generate the proper app icons:
   flutter pub get
   dart run flutter_launcher_icons

This will generate properly sized icons for Android, iOS, and other platforms based on your source image.
